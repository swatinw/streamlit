📦 Product Rating Predictor
Predict a user's product rating based on product details using machine learning!

🚀 Overview
This project is a Streamlit web app that predicts the likely user rating for a product based on inputs like:
User ID
Product Name
Brand
Category
Price
Color
Size

Built with:
Python
CatBoost Regressor (for prediction modeling)
Streamlit (for interactive web app)
Pandas (for data handling)

📈 Model

The machine learning model is trained using CatBoost Regressor, a gradient boosting algorithm that works well with categorical features and missing data.
During prediction, numerical and categorical inputs are properly handled to avoid mismatches.

✨ Features
Clean and user-friendly UI with Streamlit
Handles both numerical and categorical product features
Fast and responsive predictions
Deployed live on Streamlit Cloud

🔥 Future Improvements
Improve model accuracy with more data
Enable batch predictions for multiple products at once
